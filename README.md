In this project, the algorithm based on Monte Carlo tree search combined with Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees was implemented to develop Go AI and created GUI for Go game system. 

The USB camera module was used for computer vision to detect the position of the Go board and pieces by pattern recognition technology. 

Lynxmotion AL5D Robot Arm controlled by the SC-32U USB Servo Controller was applied to receive signals and place the go piece at the position from AI.
